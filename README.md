# Hiya! 👋 I’m Daniel

I’m a software engineer who made the leap from advertising into tech. I’ve always had a strong interest in technology, and after some time in my advertising career I decided to pursue software engineering in earnest. That led me to complete Launch School’s multi-year mastery-based software engineering program, where I built a solid foundation in computer science and engineering fundamentals.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about photography, travel, hiking, and surfing. I love thinking creatively and working collaboratively to solve interesting challenges

## 🚀Kubrick

I co-created Kubrick AI, an open-source platform that makes video content searchable through multimodal embeddings. Built on AWS serverless architecture (Lambda, SQS, S3, RDS/pgvector), Kubrick is designed for scalability, performance, and data ownership. I built it collaboratively with an international team, tackling complex architectural trade-offs together and documenting our approach in a detailed case study.
